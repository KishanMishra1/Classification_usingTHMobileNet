TensorFlow Hub is an online repository of already trained TensorFlow models that you can use. These models can either be used as is, or they can be used for Transfer Learning.

Transfer learning is a process where you take an existing trained model, and extend it to do additional work. This involves leaving the bulk of the model unchanged, while adding and retraining the final layers, in order to get a different set of possible outputs.

In this Colab we will do both.

Here, you can see all the models available in TensorFlow Module Hub.

Concepts that will be covered in this Colab

1) Use a TensorFlow Hub model for prediction.
2) Use a TensorFlow Hub model for Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
3) Do simple transfer learning with TensorFlow Hub.
